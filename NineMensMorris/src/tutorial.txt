Players take turns to play a piece of their own colour on any unoccupied point until all eighteen pieces have been played. 
After that, play continues alternately but each turn consists of a player moving one piece along a line to an adjacent empty point.

During each turn, whenever a player has three of their pieces in a line, they form a mill. 
That player then immediately removes from the board one piece belonging to the opponent that does not form part of a mill. 
If all of the opponent's pieces form mills, then the player is allowed to remove any one of the opponent's pieces. 
Players may break a mill by moving a piece out of it and then, in a subsequent turn, 
play the piece back again, thus forming a new mill and capturing another piece.
Captured pieces cannot be reclaimed and are out of the game.

When a player is reduced to three pieces they may then move to any vacant point on the board.

The player wins the game when either they reduced their opponent to two pieces or by leaving them without a legal move.
